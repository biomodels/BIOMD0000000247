Abstract:  
BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cells have evolved various response mechanisms to
counteract the deleterious consequences of oxidative stress. Among these
processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role.  
RESULTS: We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the
key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased
resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this
phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying
mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to
the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the
cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated
in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a
similar redirection of the metabolic flux.  
CONCLUSION: The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a
metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative
stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites
is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells
under stress conditions.

Different realtive enzyme velocities can be simulated by varying the
parameters **k_rel_TPI** and **k_rel_GAPDH** .
